# Pulse AI

## Under Construction

**Please note:** This project is currently under development. Features and documentation are in the process of being developed and finalized.





### Overview
Pulse AI is a super gym logger that is easy to use, clean interfaces, and has a personal AI assistant with your trainning history that can provide personalized answers and suggestions just like a reach coach would. It will suggest new workouts base on your history, for example, your split is push pull leg, and based on your history, you did a push day yesterday, the AI will suggest you do an Pull day, and create an template of recommended exercises base on your history activity, recommended weight and number of sets for the exercises. It will be a super power logger!
